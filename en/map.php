				<p>Organized by OpenStreetMap Foundation, State of the map Latam is a regional meeting aiming to increase members of the open mapping community.</p>

				<p>Its purpose is to strengthen the community of mappers, generate knowledge and share tools to audiences with less experience in the field. 
				Businesses, social organizations, students, government officials and anyone who can benefit from using mapping skills will participate in this meeting.</p>

				<p>In only one day, there will be workshops for beginners, a showcase of best regional projects, real-time mapping of Mexico City and open discussions.</p>

				<p>OpenStreetMap Foundation is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering growth, development and distribution of free geospatial 
				data. More than a million volunteers contribute to this effort. It organizes State of the Map each year in a different city, bringing together a 
				community of volunteers than take part in the OpenStreetMap project. Itâ€™s 8th edition will be held in Argentina from November 7 to 9.</p>

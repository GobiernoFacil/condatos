				<p>ConDatos is the most important regional event on open data in Latin America and the Caribbean. This year, Mexico City will be hosting academics, 
				governments, business and civil society organizations so they can interact in discussions, roundtables and workshops to enrich the debate of open data 
				on different topics.</p>

				<p>The Regional Conference for Open Data in Latin America and the Caribbean was held for the first time in 2013 in Montevideo, Uruguay bringing 
				together the most relevant actors in the region to share experiences, knowledge and expose the issues and initiatives that exist in the open data 
				world. We resume this conversation to further strengthen these efforts in an innovative and collaborative manner. ConDatos will be held in Mexico 
				City the 1 and 2 of October in the Library of Mexico known as the Ciudadela, the City of Books and Images, a cultural center that promotes 
				modernization, innovation and the use of new technologies.</p>
